# ðŸŸ¨ Node.js task


[x] CRUD operations for customers (Create, Read, Update, Delete) by email;

[x] Login and signup operations for customers;
- I add route for get user info

[x] Roles USER and ADMIN;

[x] Access token;

[x] Refresh token;

[x] Restrict access to get customers operation from unauthenticated users;
- For fun i add extra route for public access

[x] Restrict access to delete customer and update customer operations from unauthenticated users and customers with USER role;

[x] Ability to verify customer's account after signup with activation code;
- Activation code print in console (another idea was about using Mailgun)

[x] I Added some unit tests and integration tests, but because of time issues and my vacation I couldn't do full coverage, it is just an example :(
